      <div class="info">
        <p>
          As long as 20 years ago, scientists in FIU's Institute of Environment were warning about the dangerous degradation of Biscayne Bay. Increased pollution, urbanization 
          and climate change have all contributed to the precipitous decline of our iconic bay. 
          <br>
          <br>
          This August 2020, the bay experienced an obvious sign of distress. Several reports of fish kills, followed by algal blooms, were seen throughout the waterway. 
          Our scientists responded urgently to this call. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We are aggregating all of the data and information that is being collected and about Biscayne Bay on this page. Here you can find datsets and data visualizations 
          collected and developed by FIU scientists, as well as by partner organizations that are striving to restore Biscayne Bay to the healthy and thriving waterway it once was. 
          We hope to make this data available to all so that anyone can help us restore, protect and fight to save our bay.

        Marine creatures have a difficult time processing oxygen and functioning overall at

        <p class="infoText">
          Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the amount of oxygen that is present in water. 
          Although water molecules do contain an oxygen atom, this oxygen is not what is needed by aquatic organisms.

          The term "salinity" refers to the concentrations of salts in water or soils.
          As a general guideline, it is best to maintain a salinity of 1.026.
