# Biscayne-Data-Vizualization
This interdisciplinary project for the FIU Institute of Environment, aims to create an information visualization website to communicate the nuanced nature of Biscayne Bay water quality to the general public. This website will contain four types of information:

1. General information about the health of the bay provided by the FIU Institute of Environment's scientists.
2. Real-time feed from social media of the institute to display geo-located public engagement [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FIUEnvironment).
3. A map displaying water quality data from FIU CREST’s buoys which are stored in an accessible server [Research-Buoys](https://crestcache.fiu.edu/research/research-buoys/index.html). This data will be displayed and integrated using Mapbox platform [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/maps).
4. Additional real-time and archival water quality data from the institute’s partners (data type will be determined). 

In this project, you will be working on the modification and continued development of the following website: (https://fiu-staging.azurewebsites.net/casesandbox/institute-of-environment/biscayne-bay-data/index.html). 
As it is an interdisciplinary project, you will be working with a design team and students from architecture and environmental sciences. Working on this project will provide the opportunity to design and modify the user experience and the user interface of the website, using the agile scrum methodology. You will also optimize the web functionality, incorporate software techniques to create personalized features and develop the management tools necessary for the creation of an effective environmental literacy tool.
